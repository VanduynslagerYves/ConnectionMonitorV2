# Remote Connection Monitor

## Description
This will call netstat and query the ESTABLISHED connections from your client to remote clients.
Those ip addresses will be used to query extra information via a public web api: company, location (latitude & longitude).
That extra information is then used to display the location of the remote servers on a global map
